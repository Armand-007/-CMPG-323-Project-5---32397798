This project we used Power BI to present data from a excel file in different visual representations.
The first sheet is a High Lever view of all important data, it shows how many devices is registered, active and in which category and zone the devices are.
The second sheet shows Device monitoring that contains information about the devices per category and zone and it shows if the devices are online or offline.
The third sheet shows Device Registration that containd information about how many devices has been registered over a timespan, how many categories of devices was created and how many zones contain registerd devices on a timeline.

To use this program the user can use the filter to filter the information as they need it and does not have to input any additional opperations.
The visuals shows the information in a clear and in a way that is easy to understand.
